This is the Request URL for WAF classes: https://aersarm.com/api/Elosnapshot/GetCombinedResults/?weightClassType=WAF
This is the Request URL for IFA classes: https://aersarm.com/api/Elosnapshot/GetCombinedResults/?weightClassType=IFA


So the api address I need to GET from is https://aersarm.com/api/Elosnapshot/GetCombinedResults/?weightClassType with the class Type passed at the end
